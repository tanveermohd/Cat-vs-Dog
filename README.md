# Cat-vs-Dog
Binary Image Classifier
Data Collection: Gather a dataset consisting of labeled images of cats and dogs. Popular datasets for this task include the Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset or your own curated collection.

Data Preprocessing:
-Resizing: Standardize the size of all images, typically to a smaller fixed size (e.g., 128x128 pixels) to ensure uniformity and reduce computational load.
-Normalization: Scale pixel values to a range of 0 to 1 by dividing by 255. This helps in faster convergence during training.
